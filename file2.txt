As England's coronavirus vaccination programme continues, BBC News has mapped how the rollout is progressing in local areas.

Since 8 December about 18 million people have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in England.

This covers about 38% of the population over the age of 16, according to NHS England figures.
